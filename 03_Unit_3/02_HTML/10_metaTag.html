<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Meta Tag</title>
        <!-- Redirects page to given url, after 10 seconds. -->
        <meta
            http-equiv="refresh"
            content="10;url=https://www.masaischool.com/our-investors"
        />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <p>
                To use meta tag for redirection, we can use do following things
                :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>http-equiv attribute of meta tag with value "refresh"</li>
                <li>
                    and content attribute with a string having some positive
                    integer followed by ";url=" followed by a valid url.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>
                This page will redirect to Masai investors website in 10
                seconds.
