                Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the
                properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a
                fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the
                universe.

                    is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element
                    is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron,
                    H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified
                    into groups and periods based on their properties.

                <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
                <p>
                    Chemical reactions are represented using
                    <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of a
                    <i>chemical reaction:</i>
                </p>
                <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
                <p>
                    This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas
                    (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water
                    (H<sub>2</sub>O).

                    <u>Stoichiometry</u> is the calculation of reactants and
                    products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing
                    chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.

                    <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each
                    element in a molecule, while
                    <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of
                    atoms in an ion.

                <p>
                    Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world
                    around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the
                    reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every
                    aspect of our lives.
