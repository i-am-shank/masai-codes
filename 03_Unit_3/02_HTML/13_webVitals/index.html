####  Core Web Vitals :- 


Metrics of Core Web Vitals :-
  ==>   CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)   ->   How much   shifting is happening while loading of the page. In case of images, this won't happen if width & height is provided.
  ==>   LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)   ->   How much time is taken by largest element of the page to load. 
      Good LCP score  =  upto 2.5 sec.
      Needs improvement  =  upto 4 sec.
      Poor  =  anything more than 4 sec.
  ==>   FID (First Input Delay)   ->   When an input element or a link is clicked, how much time it takes to process that click. 100 miliseconds should be the target of first input delay for good user experience.

                        <li>
                            There was significant decline in performance of the
                            webpage (rated : 69).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There was a big CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), which
                            happens due to shift in layout while loading.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CLS happened, because browser decided the layout of
                            webpage at runtime, by figuring out original
                            dimension of each image.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also images were by default large in dimension, so
                            they took a little longer to load, i.e. more LCP
                            (Largest Contentful Paint).
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Performance boosted just by giving each image a
                            fixed height & width, in relative or absolute unit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CLS just dropped to 0, as every thing in layout was
                            pre-defined, due to provided dimensions of images.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gave images a smaller dimension, so they took little
                            less time to load. So slightly smaller LCP (Largest
                            Contentful Paint).

                <li>
                    Google considers it as a comparison metric to rank 2
                    webpages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most priority is given to the content of the websites, but
                    if two websites have same or similar content, then web
                    vitals is used to rank them.
